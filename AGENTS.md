## Project Overview

**CoreS3 AI Pet Firmware** is active embedded firmware for M5Stack CoreS3 / ESP32-S3. It is used as a National College Embedded Competition desktop pet demo. The CoreS3 acts as the pet head/brain, with optional base hardware for battery, PCA9685 servo control, and two-axis movement.

The current design separates the face UI from camera/AI backends: the screen renders the pet expression, while camera preview, AI voice, AI vision, storage, power, and timer features run as state-driven modules.

## Project Status

Active demo firmware. The project is no longer planning-only.

Implemented:

- Animated face UI with 11 emotions: `NORMAL`, `HAPPY`, `CURIOUS`, `LISTENING`, `THINKING`, `SPEAKING`, `SURPRISED`, `SLEEPY`, `TRACKING`, `SHY`, `SICK`.
- Touch gestures: tap, double tap, left/right/up/down swipe, long press.
- Paged menu with 7 apps: Wi-Fi, Camera, Timer, Music, System, Album, and Memo. Six icons per page with up/down swipe paging and page indicator dots.
- Settings page opened by up swipe from the Face page, with runtime brightness, volume presets, and battery voltage/percentage display.
- Memo/reminder page with NVS-persisted memos (up to 8 entries, 60 chars each) and optional timed reminders. Due reminders display on the Face page with a beep alert. Accessible from Menu and through XiaoZhi MCP tools.
- Camera preview and JPEG capture to SD.
- Camera foreground startup stabilization: startup is deferred out of touch/state callbacks, user-opened camera clears failure cooldown, CoreS3 internal I2C is released before init, touch is suspended during camera init, and a failed foreground open gets one clean deinit/retry.
- AI Vision preview and JPEG description request through a XiaoZhi-provided vision endpoint.
- Lightweight skin-color heuristic face detector for rough face-area estimation and photo/servo centering. It is not ML face detection or recognition.
- Face-page vision runtime that runs local heuristic detection in short bursts instead of keeping camera capture permanently active.
- IMU orientation based Pomodoro timer with four presets and screen rotation.
- SD MP3/WAV music player. MP3 output is mixed to mono for the CoreS3 speaker at a conservative default volume.
- Shared safe servo motion layer for Face touch/expression reactions, XiaoZhi pet reactions, XiaoZhi `self.servo.control` commands, and the dance demo. Face and XiaoZhi expression poses keep the mechanical center at pan 90 degrees and tilt 140 degrees.
- PCA9685 servo driver self-disables after three missing-device scans so an unplugged base does not keep polling PortA forever.
- Bond/affinity page opened by down swipe from Face. The main affinity score persists in NVS, while recent detail text is runtime-only.
- XiaoZhi OTA activation/config, TLS WebSocket, Opus mic upload, Opus TTS playback, MCP handshake, and MCP tools.
- Wi-Fi auto reconnect, SD retry/fallback, PMU battery voltage reading, brownout safe mode, and basic power/sleep handling.
- Audio buffer optimization: mic capture and Opus encode buffers use INTERNAL RAM for DMA stability; playback buffers use PSRAM.
- AI page swipe optimization: right-swipe from AI page uses `pauseForForegroundTool()` to preserve the WebSocket connection; long press still fully closes the channel.

Removed or intentionally not implemented:

- Servo Test page and `servo_test_ui.*` have been removed. Do not restore the menu entry unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- Real ML local face detection and face recognition are not implemented. Do not describe the skin-color heuristic as face recognition.
- PID gimbal tracking or autonomous base behavior. Current servo support is safe open-loop pose control plus heuristic centering hooks.
- Full-duplex audio interruption or echo cancellation.

## FreeRTOS Tasks

| Task | Function | Frequency |
|------|----------|-----------|
| UI | Draw active screen with PSRAM canvas where possible | 20 FPS |
| Touch | Read touch and emit gestures | 50 Hz |
| Camera | Push camera frames to Camera Debug / AI Vision UI when capture is running | 15 FPS |
| Vision | Heuristic detection/tracking loop when face vision is enabled | 5 FPS |
| AI | Process XiaoZhi WebSocket, activation, audio channel requests | 50 Hz tick |
| Power | Battery/sleep status update | 1 Hz |

## Gesture Routing

- Face: right swipe -> Menu; left swipe or double tap -> AI; down swipe -> Bond; up swipe -> Settings; tap top -> HAPPY + nod; tap bottom -> SHY + look down; tap left/right -> CURIOUS with gaze and pan servo; long press -> Sleep.
- AI: single tap toggles listening; right swipe or long press -> Face.
- Bond: Back, up swipe, or left swipe -> Face.
- Settings: Back, left swipe, or down swipe -> Face.
- Menu: tap app icon -> Wi-Fi, Camera, Timer, Music, System, Album, or Memo; up/down swipe pages; Back -> Face; left swipe -> Face.
- Camera Debug: SHOT -> optionally center a heuristic face region, then save JPEG to `/photos`; Back or left swipe -> Menu.
- AI Vision: Back or left swipe -> close preview and return to AI.
- Pomodoro: IMU orientation selects preset before start; Start/Pause/Reset buttons control timer; Back or left swipe -> Menu.
- Music: Play/Pause, Stop, Next, Back; left swipe -> Menu; clockwise twist skips to next track.
- Memo: Back -> Menu.
- Sleep: tap, double tap, or shake -> Face.

## XiaoZhi AI Notes

- OTA endpoint is `https://api.tenclass.net/xiaozhi/ota/`.
- Firmware identity comes from `XIAOZHI_BOARD_TYPE` and `XIAOZHI_FIRMWARE_VERSION` in `src/config/app_config.h`.
- The client sends a WebSocket `hello` with Opus audio parameters and MCP enabled.
- Audio upload is 16 kHz mono Opus, 60 ms frames, 24 kbps target bitrate.
- Returned TTS Opus is decoded at the server-provided sample rate and played through M5Unified Speaker.
- CoreS3 mic and speaker are handled as half-duplex.
- MCP tools currently exposed:
  - `self.camera.open`
  - `self.camera.close`
  - `self.camera.capture_photo`
  - `self.vision.describe_scene`
  - `self.pomodoro.open`
  - `self.music.control`
  - `self.pet.react`
  - `self.servo.control`
  - `self.device.status`
  - `self.device.control`
  - `self.memo.add`
  - `self.memo.list`
  - `self.memo.remove`
- AI Vision only works when the XiaoZhi MCP initialize params provide a vision URL/token.
- `self.servo.control` supports `center`, `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`, `nod`, `shake`, `dance`, and `release`. It must not switch pages or reopen the XiaoZhi audio channel. `dance` starts servo motion first, then uses `/music` when available; music or SD failure must not cancel the servo motion.

## Face Detection Notes

Do not fake real face recognition.

`FaceDetector` currently uses a lightweight skin-color heuristic backend. It can report rough face-like blobs for expression effects and open-loop servo centering, but it is not an ESP-DL/ESP-WHO ML model and must not be described as identity recognition.

The Face page runs detection only in short windows:

- Boot burst when not in brownout safe mode.
- Touch, swipe, double tap, shake, twist, and AI-return bursts.
- Occasional short idle rescans.

Camera Debug, AI Vision, and photo capture may open the camera immediately because those are explicit foreground camera features.

## Stability Notes

- Brownout reset activates a safe-mode window that suppresses automatic Face-page camera bursts and startup chime.
- Low battery handling stops Face-page vision capture and switches the face to `SLEEPY` without forcing deep sleep.
- Foreground camera startup owns camera reinitialization and may suspend the touch task briefly to avoid CoreS3 internal I2C contention.
- Servo companion motion pauses while Face-page vision burst capture is active to reduce current spikes.
- PCA9685 scanning stops permanently after three not-found attempts for the current boot.

## Development Rules

- Preserve user changes. Check `git status --short` before editing.
- Keep Wi-Fi credentials in `src/config/wifi_secrets.h`; never commit real SSID/password files.
- Build with `pio run` unless the user explicitly asks not to compile.
- Keep display rendering centralized through UI classes and PSRAM `M5Canvas` where possible.
- Keep camera framebuffer lifetime explicit: release frames after use and never use data after returning/freeing the framebuffer.
- SD card handling must tolerate missing/flaky cards without rebooting. The retry sequence is 25, 10, 4, and 1 MHz.
- Stop music before exclusive speaker/mic use by XiaoZhi AI or Pomodoro completion melody.
- Do not claim face recognition, closed-loop PID gimbal tracking, or autonomous base behavior.
- Bond recent interaction detail is runtime-only even though the main affinity score persists.
- Memo data persists in NVS but reminder display is runtime-only. Memo reminders depend on NTP time sync.
- Audio buffers: mic capture and Opus encode must use `MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL`; playback buffers may use `MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM`. Do not move capture/encode buffers to PSRAM.
- XiaoZhi WebSocket connection is blocking (called from AI task, does not block UI). Audio buffers: playback must use PSRAM.

## GitHub Hygiene

- Commit `src/config/wifi_secrets.example.h`, not `src/config/wifi_secrets.h`.
- Do not commit build output, monitor logs, `.pio`, local editor database files, or local secrets.
- The GitHub Actions workflow should run PlatformIO, not the default CMake starter workflow.
- README files should describe current firmware behavior, not older planning-stage design.
